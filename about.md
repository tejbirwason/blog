Hi, I'm Tj.

I am a software consultant based out of Vancouver and San Francisco.

I've been in the game for 6 years now. Iâ€™ve worked for multi-thousand employees public listed companies, small startups, and everything in between.

My last job was at SAP helping build their flagship analytics product in Vancouver, Canada.

Currently I consult for a startup in San Diego called [Up n' go](https://www.upngo.com/]).

Here are some [buzzwords](https://www.tejbirwason.com) that might make you want to hire me.

Have a good day!
