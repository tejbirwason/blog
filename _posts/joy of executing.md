Out of all of this I have also realized that I truly enjot the execution phase of the plan as well. It is very similar to coding up a design that has been put through the ringer, modified, corrected and approved for development. All that needs to be done is the sweet joyful part of coding it up. Execution is fun only if you have a solid trust in the plan and the goal. So develop that trust, be prepared to execute against a plan that is often faulty, and then quickly course correct to keep on hammering.
