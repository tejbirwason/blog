title: Plan and execute
---

During all my recent travel around South East Asia, almost everyday consists of an executive decision on how to structure the day, when to move from one accomodation to another, when and where to go sight seeing, when to skip certain tourist traps, when to be more social and when to be alone.

I cannot claim to be a good decision maker. I often defer a decision to a superior for fear of dealing with unwanted repurcusions. I thought that quiting my full-time job and beginning to travel taught me how to make my own plan, but in reality it is the travel itself that has been a crash course in learning how to make executive decisions. Particularily solo travel that allows you to craft an experience for yourself.

Travellers often tire from a decision paralysis which at its core is a failure to avoid second guessing oneself. Non-stop second guessing is tiresome and exhausting. The antidote is a deep trust in your instincts. Surely your instincts will be biased in a multitude of ways, but they are your only internal source of truth. The trust placed in a plan based off your instincts will help while executing as you will be operating from a personal source of truth (at a given point of time). The plan will often be wrong but you must trust yourself to course correct quickly and get back on path. (Coincidentally, what people perceive as surface-level self confidence is actually a refined trust of instincts)

Anytime that I have trusted my instincts and made decisions, things have only gotten better. As a result, I am developing a keener sense of listening to that instict. Travel in particular has allowed me to put a closer ear to my instincts. The consequential trust liberates me to plan quickly and then efficiently execute against it. Do not expect the plan to always be the right as there will be always be some trial and error to get to a better plan. But if you never start you will never know.
