title: Hello World, again
---

The last time I tried started a blog, it only went so far. I got a couple of posts out in the first few weeks and then fell off. I failed to develop the cadence necessary to stay consistent and publish often.

I cannot claim that a lot has changed from the time I wrote my first blog post. The only change in mindset is to write write as though no one is reading, and write with the intent of simply clarifying my thoughts and getting better at writing. As a consequence, I suspect often the tone of the blog will be self prescriptive which right now seems like the only way to trick myself to write often.

So here we go, hello world again. Let's stay in touch longer this time, shall we.
